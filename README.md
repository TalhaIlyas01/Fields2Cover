## Installation

This code has been tested with ROS 1 noetic and melodic, and ROS 2 galatic, humble and rolling.

### ROS 1
First, install [ROS noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) and create a [workspace (from now: catkin_ws/ )](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace).

From `catkin_ws/` clone and compile the package as:
```
git clone https://github.com/Fields2Cover/Fields2Cover src/fields2cover
git clone https://github.com/Fields2Cover/fields2cover_ros src/fields2cover_ros
rosdep install -r --ignore-src -y --from-paths .
catkin_make_isolated
```

### ROS 2

Install [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html) and create your workspace as `mkdir ws`.

From `ws/` clone and compile the package as:
```
git clone https://github.com/Fields2Cover/Fields2Cover src/fields2cover
git clone https://github.com/Fields2Cover/fields2cover_ros src/fields2cover_ros
rosdep install -r --ignore-src -y --from-paths .
colcon build
```


## Running a demo (Only on ROS 1)

To run an interactive demo, run:

```
roslaunch fields2cover_ros view_field.launch
```

A rviz and a rqt_reconfigure windows will appear, so you can interactively modify the path created:
